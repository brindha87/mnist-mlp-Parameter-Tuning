# mnist-mlp-Parameter-Tuning

In this mini project, the neural network is modified in mnist_mlp.ipynb to compare the resultant model configurations.

Instructions
Take note of the validation loss and test accuracy for the model resulting from each of the below changes. 
(Try out each amendment in a separate model.)

1. Increase (or decrease) the number of nodes in each of the hidden layers.
Did you notice evidence of overfitting (or underfitting)?

2. Increase (or decrease) the number of hidden layers. 
Do you notice evidence of overfitting (or underfitting)?

3. Remove the dropout layers in the network.
Do you notice evidence of overfitting?

4. Remove the Relu activation functions.
Does the accuracy decrease?

5. Remove the image pre-processing step with dividing every pixel by 255.
Does the accuracy decrease?

6. Try a different optimizer such as Stochastic Gradient Descent.

7. Increase or decrease the batch size.
